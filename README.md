### Project Overview üîç
**HoopReserve** makes reserving local basketball courts easy and fair. By allowing users to book court time in advance, it helps prevent conflicts over who gets to play, ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity. The simple booking process lets players plan their games without hassle, so they can focus on enjoying the sport. It's not just about convenience‚Äîit's about building a respectful, connected community where everyone has a fair chance to use the court.

### Application of Python Concepts üêç
The  Basketball Court Reservation System effectively illustrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Below is an explanation of how these principles were applied:

- **Classes and Objects (OOP Basics)** üóÇÔ∏è

    -	Classes are used to represent the main entities in the system: `User`, `Reservation`, and `ReservationManager.`
    - Each class has attributes (such as `name`,` contact`, `start_time`, `end_time`) and methods (such as `__init__`, `create_reservation`, `update_reservation`) that define its behavior.
    -	The ReservationManager class manages the interactions between User and Reservation objects, keeping track of existing reservations and providing user-facing methods for registration and reservation handling


- **Properties and Encapsulation** ü©π
    
    -	The `User` and `Reservation` classes use private attributes (e.g., `self._name`, `self._contact`) to store data.
    -	Properties (`@property`) are used to allow controlled access to these private attributes. For example, the `name`, `contact`, and `address` properties in the `User` class provide read-only access to the attributes.
    -	This ensures that users cannot directly modify attributes like `self._name` from outside the class, thus protecting the integrity of the data.


- **Class Methods and Instance Methods** üìÑ
  
    - Instance Methods (e.g., `__init__`, `update_reservation`) define behavior that operates on individual instances of the class.
    -	Class Methods (e.g., `from_dict`) operate on the class itself, not on an individual instance. They are used to create instances from external data (like a dictionary), which is useful for serialization or deserialization tasks.

    
- **List and Data Management** üóÑÔ∏è
  
    -	Lists are used to manage multiple reservations. The `ReservationManager` class uses a list (`self._reservations`) to store all reservations created during the session.
    -	You use loops and conditional statements to manage and check reservation availability, allowing the system to handle multiple reservations efficiently.
      

- **File Handling and JSON Serialization**
  
    - File I/O is used to save reservations to a JSON file. The method `save_reservation_to_json` reads from a file and writes data in JSON format, allowing you to persist data across sessions.
    - JSON Serialization: The `to_dict()` method in both `User` and `Reservation` classes converts objects to dictionaries, making it easy to store and retrieve them in a JSON format.
      

- **Input/Output and Interaction**
  
    -	User Input: The system relies on user input to gather information for registration and reservations (e.g., `input()`).
    -	Print Statements: The code uses `print()` to interact with the user, showing status messages, reservation details, and receipts.
      

- **Conditionals and Loops**
  
    -	If-Else Statements: The code uses `if-else` to check whether a reservation exists, validate user input, and check for availability (e.g., in `is_date_available` and `create_reservation`).
    -	While Loop: The main program runs in an infinite loop (`while True`), allowing the user to interact with the system until they choose to exit by inputting 7.


- **Exception Handling**
  
    -	Try-Except Blocks: The code handles errors using `try-except` to manage potential issues like file not being found or invalid JSON format. This ensures the program doesn‚Äôt crash and can recover gracefully.


- **String Formatting**
  
    -	The `__str__` method in both` User` and `Reservation` classes uses f-string formatting to create user-friendly output.
 

- **Static Variables**

    -	The `Reservation` class uses a static variable `_counter` to keep track of the reservation ID. Each new reservation gets a unique ID by incrementing this counter.

**Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**  
  HoopReserve aligns perfectly with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. By offering a fair and respectful system for reserving basketball courts, it promotes inclusivity, prevents conflicts, and ensures everyone has equal access to community spaces. Beyond fairness, structured bookings allow for better maintenance planning, keeping courts clean, safe, and enjoyable for all. This isn‚Äôt just about convenience‚Äîit‚Äôs about fostering respect, connection, and sustainability in urban communities. HoopReserve helps create vibrant, well-managed spaces where everyone can come together and play.
